Congratulations! Your monthly Full Farm CSA contribution payment is now pending, which means that you should see your monthly payment amount taken out of your bank account soon. It can take 7-10 days to show up in your member store budget after that.

If you are waiting on this payment amount to make an order in the member store, and would like to do so before then, you always have the option to make a one time credit card payment to "top up" your account, which you can do on the "Manage Payments" page in the member store. Please let us know if you have any questions!

Best,
The Full Farm CSA Team
