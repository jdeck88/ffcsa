Thank you for signing up for the Full Farm CSA.

We are excited to have you as a member and look forward to providing you with the best fresh produce, meat, milk, and
 eggs from our local member farms!

Our Dairy Manager will be reaching out within the next few business days to go over a few points regarding our Raw
 Dairy Program. After this conversation we will be able to activate your account and you can then make your first order.

If you would like to pay for the entire year in advance, send a personal check made out to "Full
 Farm CSA" without the $100 sign up fee by mail to:
 PO box 565 Junction City, OR 97448

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.

Thanks,
Ella and the team
