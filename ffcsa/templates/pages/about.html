          <p class="body-1 text-justify	">The Full Farm CSA is a personally crafted, full diet CSA program serving Portland, Eugene, and Corvallis, where members choose how much to contribute as well as which products they get each week to create a well-rounded, seasonal diet all year-round! The FFCSA includes staples such as organic vegetables and grains, seasonal fruit, grass fed and pasture-raised meat, as well as animal fats (lard), honey and walnuts and members end up eating “whole” foods and cooking at home more often. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a food system model that builds connections between community members and their farmers, making food production a community event where the benefits and risks are shared. We use the term “Member” in place of “Consumer” as each member is fully invested and an integral part of making the CSA happen. Member farms benefit from educated and invested community members, while community members benefit from transparency and the convenience of having all of their week’s groceries delivered!</p>

                All of member farms are committed to producing local and nutrient dense
                foods so that by working together, we can bring you a truly full diet CSA.
                The Full Farm CSA’s first priority is to sell products grown on farms in
                the Willamette Valley and throughout the season, we sometimes reach out to other local partners to
                fill our member store. In the case that it is not possible to grow an ingredient this
                hyper-locally, we will also support local business which<em>use as local products as possible</em>
                (i.e. it is virtually impossible to grow coffee in Oregon, so our Organic
                Coffee is grown in South America, but sourced from a local Roaster).
                We always put the name of the farmer on the listed product so that
                members can stay connected to the source of their food.

                On the <span class="text-blue-700">online member store</span>, members have
                an account where they can use their monthly contribution to order whichever
                products they like each week. Each item has a “value” which reflects the cost
                to the FFCSA to get that product to the member. There are two ordering periods
                in the week, depedning which dropsite you choose. Saturday 10am-Sunday
                midnight OR Tuesday 10 am-Wednesday midnight. The member store is updated at
                the start of each ordering period with the latest inventory, which changes to
                reflect all the goodies that are at the peak of ripeness. There are also
                seasonal recipe boxes, that are easily added your cart with one click, making
                meal planning for the week even easier!
                <strong>Members must make their order during the ordering periods, so please make
                  sure all desired items are in your cart before the deadline, or you will not
                  get an order for that week.</strong>
                Carts will be automatically submitted at midnight, there is no need to
                hit a “submit button”. We will do our best to fill your order completely, but
                sometimes due to unpredictable weather and seasonal variations, we cannot
                guarantee that we will have everything in your order. Members can choose
                whether they would like substitutions made via their account settings. In the
                peak of the growing season, we encourage members to order extra for freezing
                and canning to supplement the winter months. We may ask that you limit
                consumption of some items (such as early season tomatoes), so that all FFCSA
                members will have an equal opportunity to enjoy the bounty!

                <div>Do you offer home delivery?</div>
                <div>Yes! We currently offer home delivery in Eugene, Junction City, and Corvallis. We are looking at expanding to other cities, so let us know if you would like to be notified when we are in your area! We charge a $5 fee for home delivery. If you order more then $125, we will deliver for free! Home deliveries happen on Saturday. Your produce and dry goods will be delivered in a cardboard box and your meat and dairy items will be placed in your cooler. The morning of your delivery, you will need to place a cooler on your porch, to receive any meat, dairy, or other frozen products you may have ordered, as well as your empty box and any glass jars from the week before. We will pick up these items and re-use them. Please make sure any jars are labeled with your name so we can refund your bottle deposit.</div>

                <div>Members who come to the farm can enjoy Seasonal Farm Dinners.  Members who don’t normally pick up at the farm can change their dropsite before the Wednesday order deadline so that they can come for dinner that week if during summertime, or if they’d just like to just come out for a visit and pick up their order at the farm for that week. We encourage all members to come check out the farm at least once during their time in the FFCSA!</div>

          <p class="subtitle-1">We recently celebrated our 15th anniversary of farming in the Willamette Valley. In that time, we have raised and cared for thousands of animals, watched our children grow, and provided a place for our colleagues to work and interns to live as together we all learned the ins and outs of pasture-based farming. In an effort to support our local food community and be a resource to the aspiring generations of regenerative farmers, we intend to make no compromises in practicing and teaching what we believe to be the necessary future of farming. The journey has surprised and humbled us, we have triumphed and been defeated; but the joys of our labor reward us every day, reminding us why we love to do what we do.</p>
          <p class="subtitle-1">Our farm operation is varied and involved. Our enterprises include management intensive grazing, livestock handling and birthing, haying, meat processing, building projects, and general farm maintenance. Our conservation initiatives have included wetland, riparian, and forest restoration projects.</p>

              <p class="subtitle-1">At Deck Family Farm, we take a long-term approach developing a sustainable livestock operation. We intend to improve the health of the land that houses and surrounds the farm, which will in turn produce a greater bounty and allow us to work in closer tandem with nature. The farm does not use herbicides, pesticides, hormones, antibiotics or synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Instead, we generate soil fertility through the natural cycles of composting, grazing management, and seeding a variety of grasses. We aspire to create a model that can be replicated and that does not harm the planet in ways that are associated with industrial, mono-cropped systems of agriculture.</p>
