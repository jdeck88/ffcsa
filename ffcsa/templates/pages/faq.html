          The Full Farm CSA is a personally crafted, full diet CSA program serving Portland, Eugene, and Corvallis. Members choose how much to contribute as well as which products they get each week to create a well-rounded, seasonal diet all year-round! The FFCSA includes staples such as organic vegetables, grains, seasonal fruit, grass fed and pasture-raised meat, dairy, animal fats, honey, nuts, and various pantry items. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a food system model that builds connections between community members and their farmers, making food production a community event where the benefits and risks are shared. We use the term “Member” in place of “Consumer” as each member is fully invested and an integral part of making the CSA happen. Member farms benefit from educated and invested community members, while community members benefit from transparency and the convenience of having all their week’s groceries delivered!

        The FFCSA includes staples such as seasonal organic vegetables, heirloom grains, grass fed and pasture raised meat, animal fats (such as lard) honey, nuts, coffee, and a variety of pantry items (fruit spread, salsa, pickles, tuna, popcorn, tomato sauces etc.). We aim to provide a full diet offering a variety of products year-round so that members can eat locally and seasonally all the time! A projected seasonal availability chart can be viewed at the bottom of this page and interested members can also check out our <a href="https://ffcsa-staging.deckfamilyfarm.com/products/">online member store</a> to get a feel for the different product options available.

          The Full Farm CSA’s priority is to provide products grown on farms in the Willamette Valley- as close to home as possible. In the case that it’s not possible to grow an ingredient hyper-locally, we will also support local business which use as local products as possible (i.e., it is virtually impossible to grow coffee in Oregon, so our Organic Coffee is grown in South America, but sourced from a local Roaster). We always put the name of the farmer on the listed product so that members can stay connected to the source of their food. All our community farms are committed to producing local and nutrient dense foods. By working together, we can bring you a truly full diet CSA.

        Sign-ups are all year round! You can sign up <a href="https://ffcsa-staging.deckfamilyfarm.com/accounts/signup/?next=/faq/">here</a>, or, if you have any questions, give us a call at (541) 321-0925 or send us an email at fullfarmcsa@deckfamilyfarm.com and we would be happy to walk you through the process. Members make a verbal commitment to sign up for 6-months to help provide stability to our member farms. Subscription amounts are sliding scale, based on what the family or individual wants to contribute, with a $172/month minimum contribution for each household. The maximum contribution is endless! For the “full diet challenge” (committing to eating only a seasonal and local diet for a year!) our suggestion is $80/week per adult and $40/week for children 6-10yrs.  Any amount left over in an account at the end of the month will be “rolled over” into a credit for next month’s ordering.  FFCSA members can also top up their account if running low at the end of the month. During the sign-up process, automatically recurring monthly payments are set up on member’s online accounts. Members can easily view and change their monthly budgets at any time. A breakdown of amounts contributed, and amounts ordered on the “order history” tab is also available.

        Orders are placed through the <a href="https://ffcsa-staging.deckfamilyfarm.com/products/">online member store</a> and by creating a member account. There are two ordering periods in the week, depending on which drop site you choose. For deliveries in Eugene, Springfield, and Junction City the order period is Saturday 10am-Sunday midnight. For deliveries in Portland and Corvallis the ordering period is Tuesday 10 am-Wednesday midnight. The member store is updated at the start of each ordering period with the latest inventory, which changes to reflect all the goodies that are at the peak of ripeness. <b>Members must make their order during the ordering periods, so please make sure all desired items are in your cart before the deadline, or you will not get an order for that week.</b> Carts will be automatically submitted at midnight, there is no need to hit a “submit button”. We will do our best to fill your order completely, but sometimes due to unpredictable weather and seasonal variations, we cannot guarantee that we will have everything in your order. Members can choose whether they would like substitutions made via their account settings. In the peak of the growing season, we encourage members to order extra for freezing and canning to supplement the winter months.

          Yes! We currently offer home delivery in Eugene/Springfield, Junction City, and Corvallis. We are looking at expanding to other cities, so let us know if you would like to be notified when we are in your area! We charge a $5 fee for home delivery. If you order more than $125, we will deliver for free! Home deliveries are Wednesday, Thursday (Eugene/Springfield locations) and Saturday (Corvallis locations). Your produce and dry goods will be delivered in a cardboard box. The morning of your delivery, you will need to place a cooler on your porch to receive any meat, dairy, or other frozen products you may have ordered, as well as your empty box and any glass jars from the week before. We will pick up these items and re-use them. Please make sure any jars are labeled with your name so we can refund your bottle deposit.

        We offer a $4 credit for returning clean, dry, 1/2 gallon glass jars with PLASTIC lids attached (we will not give credit for jars returned missing lids, lids other than the provided plastic lids or dirty jars). Please keep returns to a limit of 10 jars at a time- we don’t always have the time and space to accept more than this. All of our locations accept jar returns. If you are returning jars to one of our farmers market locations, please give them to one of our friendly representatives. We love it if you can return the quarts and pints as well but don’t offer deposits for them at this time.

        Yes! If you would like to skip a week or two, no problem. We only deliver when you make an order. We do require that families remain active and maintain a weekly average order of $40 throughout the year, so sporadic orders can work within our program, so long as the minimum budget is met!
