                            The Full Farm CSA (FFCSA) is a personally crafted, full diet CSA program serving Portland,
                            Eugene, and Corvallis. Members choose how much to contribute as well as which products they
                            get each week to create a well-rounded, seasonal diet all year-round!
                            <br/>
                            Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a food system model that builds connections between
                            community members and their farmers, making food production a community event where the
                            benefits and risks are shared. We use the term “Member” in place of “Consumer” as each
                            member is fully invested and an integral part of making the CSA happen. Community members
                            benefit from transparency and the convenience of having all their week’s groceries delivered
                            while Member farms benefit from educated and invested community members!

                            You choose what you get-the flexible ordering system works for all types of eaters whether
                            they be omnivorous, vegetarian, keto or purely carnivorous!

                            We aim to provide a full diet offering a variety of products year-round so that members can
                            eat locally and seasonally all the time. <!--A projected seasonal availability chart can be

                            The Full Farm CSA’s priority is to provide products grown on farms in the Willamette Valley-
                            as close to home as possible. In the case that it’s not possible to grow an ingredient
                            hyper-locally, we will also support local business which use as local products as possible
                            (i.e., it is virtually impossible to grow coffee in Oregon, so our Organic Coffee is grown
                            in South America, but sourced from a local Eugene Roaster). We always put the name of the
                            farmer on the listed product so that members can stay connected to the source of their food.
                            All our community farms are committed to producing local and nutrient dense foods. By
                            working together, we can bring you a truly full diet CSA.

                            During the sign-up process, automatically recurring monthly payments will be set up and you

                            maximum contribution is endless! For the “full diet challenge” (committing to eating only a
                            seasonal and local diet for a year!) our suggestion is $80/week per adult and $40/week for

                            member store</a> and by creating a member account. There
                            are two ordering periods in the week, depending on which drop site you choose. For
                            deliveries in Eugene, Springfield, and Junction City the order period is Saturday
                            10am-Sunday midnight. For deliveries in Portland and Corvallis the ordering period is
                            Tuesday 10 am-Wednesday midnight.

                            The member store is updated at the start of each ordering period with the latest inventory,
                            which changes to reflect all the goodies that are at the peak of ripeness. Members must make
                            their order during the ordering periods, so please make sure all desired items are in your
                            cart before the deadline, or you will not get an order for that week. Carts will be
                            automatically submitted at midnight, there is no need to hit a “submit button”.
                            <br/>
                            We will do our best to fill your order completely, but sometimes due to unpredictable
                            weather and seasonal variations, we cannot guarantee that we will have everything in your
                            order. Members can choose whether they would like substitutions made via their account
                            settings. In the peak of the growing season, we encourage members to order extra for
                            freezing and canning to supplement the winter months.

                            accept jar returns. If you are returning jars to one of our farmers market locations, please
                            give them to one of our friendly representatives. We love it if you can return the quarts
                            and pints as well but don’t offer deposits for them at this time.

                            Yes! If you would like to skip a week or two, no problem. We only deliver when you make an
                            order. We do require that families remain active and maintain a weekly average order of $40
                            throughout the year, so sporadic orders can work within our program, so long as the minimum
                            budget is met!
